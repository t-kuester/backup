IDEAS
- support backup on removeable & remote drives
- do I really have to os.walk the files in the directories,
  or can I compress the directory as a whole?
- add folders by drag-and-drop
- show size?

BUGS
- exception if backup archive already exists
  - fehler beim verschieben der datei??? wieso?
- thread hangs on second backup?
- UI not properly refreshed?
- no updates written when killed in between
- hidden-"." only replaced in last path segment (not e.g. for mail-subfolder)
