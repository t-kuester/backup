IDEAS
- support backup on removeable & remote drives
- do I really have to os.walk the files in the directories,
  or can I compress the directory as a whole?
- add folders by drag-and-drop
- show size?
- only date in table, time only on tooltip
- update readme
- disable buttons while backup is underway
- use "format" again in pattern resolution and allow custom date/time format
- use some kind of date formatter in GTK Table View?
- option: strip home dir
- archive files should not include full paths

BUGS
- continued load and hanging after backup
- thread hangs on second backup?
- UI not properly refreshed?
- no updates written when killed in between
- hidden-"." only replaced in last path segment (not e.g. for mail-subfolder)
- files not properly compressed, zip is like tar
