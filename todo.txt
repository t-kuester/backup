TODO
- archive files should not include full paths
- update readme, screenshot, docstrings

TEST
- incremental backup
- kill ui before update is complete
- proper sync between model and UI in different situations

NICE TO HAVE
- warning before overwriting files?
- support backup on removeable & remote drives
- add folders by drag-and-drop
- use "format" again in pattern resolution and allow custom date/time format
- individual progress bars for each directory (in the table)

REFACTORING
- do I really have to os.walk the files in the directories,
  or can I compress the directory as a whole?
- merge config into model, proper module structure
