CORE
- support backup on removeable & remote drives
- do not include parent dir in zip, but put zip into parent dir
- make auto-include attribute of configuration...
- ... or make directory.include an enum of "yes/no/auto"
- problems with name-pattern and target dir?
- exception if backup archive already exists
- recognize and expand "~" in target path

UI
- simplify cell renderer creation code
- make archive type (and possibly auto-include) a combo in the table
- show progress of backup, in status bar, progress bar, or spinner in table?
