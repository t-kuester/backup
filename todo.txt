CORE
- support backup on removeable & remote drives
- do not include parent dir in zip, but put zip into parent dir
- problems with name-pattern and target dir?
- exception if backup archive already exists
- do I really have to os.walk the files in the directories, or can I compress
  the directory as a whole?

UI
- simplify cell renderer creation code
- show progress of backup, in status bar, progress bar, or spinner in table?
- individual progress bars for each directory?
