"""Core Components for simple Backup tool.
by Tobias KÃ¼ster, 2016

This module contains the algorithms and the logic for actually creating the
backup. It can also be used for creating a backup from command line. Besides
the actual backup-creation, this also provides helper methods for determining
when a file was changed and whether a new backup is due.
